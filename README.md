# Unaffordable Living in WA State

  The goal of this project is to examine the trend, which area is people are struggling the most while living in WA State. It is to show that even though WA State can be rank #1 in the country, it's still one of the most expensive state to live in especially around Seattle area. Data Sources that are mostly used within this project is obtained from [Washing State Geospatial Open Portal](https://geo.wa.gov/). Basemap is from CartoDB providing a light color background to help minimize distraction and only focus on data being used wtihin the webmap. You can see that a lot of high data values are focused around Seattle area. While exploring the webmap of the projects. You can find many dark shaded area when zoomed in around Seattle area and counties near the area. These areas tend to contain a lot of people living in poverty, and those who don't have enough to spare and live their life checks by checks. Due to high population within the main cities in WA State and the booming expansion of tech industry, it has become more expensive to live in within these cities, and that accounts for the rise in poverty rate but also homeless population. In addition, real estate made it impossible to purchase a house because it's too expensive, and many spend most of their checks just on rent alone. If a person spend most of their checks just on rent, then a house for them isn't suitable which force them to leave the state to find an another affordable living that's not in WA.
